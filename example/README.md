Example
-------

There is a simple example(`example.php`) in the example folder. It creates three
indexed-color images with different dither values and five colors(white, black, red,
green and blue).

There is an additional example(`png_example.php`) in the example folder. It calculates a color palette and then
very slowly uses the same dithering algorithm. (However, it is currently VERY slow with a fair number of colors in the
palette!)
